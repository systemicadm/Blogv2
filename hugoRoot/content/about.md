I'm a Windows Systems Administrator with 10 years experience that started out on the basic/tier 1 help desk. Outside of work I enjoy a variety of nerdy hobbies including PC/console gaming, video game streaming, D&D, Magic the Gathering and mentoring others into tech. 


## So why this blog?

This is probably my 4th attempt at maintaining a blog. I've created blogs using blogspot, tumblr and wordpress before this. I just stopped or gave up writing them for various reasons (Other projects/interests, lack of time to maintain, etc.). My new goal is now to create a blog that's a static site so it can be hosted for cheap and carry my posts about random, hard to figure out IT troubles I come across. 

Thanks for reading!
