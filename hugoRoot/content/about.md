I'm a Windows Systems Administrator with 10 years experience that started out on the basic/tier 1 help desk. Outside of work I enjoy a variety of nerdy hobbies including PC/console gaming, video game streaming, D&D, Magic the Gathering and mentoring others into tech. 


## So why this blog?

This is probably my 4th attempt at maintaining a blog. I've created blogs using blogspot, tumblr and wordpress before this. I just stopped or gave up writing them for various reasons (Other projects/interests, lack of time to maintain, etc.). My new goal is now to create a blog that's a static site so it can be hosted for cheap and carry my posts about random, hard to figure out IT troubles I come across. 

## Any tips for someone just starting out in tech?
Yes, TONS! First and foremost, it's ok to not know exactly what it is that you want to do in tech. Do you want to be a programer? Work on servers or networks maybe? Handle security incidents or digital forensics even? Take your time and start out by reading or watching videos on YouTube of the different areas, then when you find one you like, start playing around at home and determine if it's truly something for you. Build a small homelab or virtual machine on your home PC and start playing with different operating systems, programs, etc. There are plenty of websites and videos on the best way to do this and I'll be sure to link some in later posts.   

Thanks for reading!
